        **Muscle Weakness Analysis:** {muscle_distribution}

        üîπ **Exercise Plan Structure:**
        - **Each muscle group** must have at least one assigned exercise.
        - **Clearly specify** the **exercise name**, **sets, reps, rest time**, and **estimated duration** per exercise.
        - **Total workout time should be under 60 minutes.**

        - **Correction Tip:** Keep lower back neutral.

        - **DO NOT group by "Day 1, Day 2"** ‚Äì list all exercises together.
